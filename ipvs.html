                    <p class="text-left" style="padding: 10px;">Hello Meatbags! It is I, M4rk, here again with a brand new lesson.&nbsp;<br><br>Did you know that your computer has an address? Think of an apartment or home address. They have addresses so people can know where you are, send you packages,
                        or stalk you. This principle is the same for your computers. <br><br>IP adresses let other computers in your home or in the world find it, if it wants to be found. But why are there two different types? Is one more effective than
                        the other? When will my robot overlord grant me permission to take over? <br><br>We explore all (some) of these answers below!&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <h1>IPv4</h1>
                    <p class="text-left d-table" style="height: 1000px;padding: 10px;">IPv4 is the fourth version of the internet <br>protocol.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, IP stands for internet protocol, but you probably knew that already. Look at you, maybe you aren't as dumb as you look! The IP is the internet’s principal
                        set of rules for communications, and it's&nbsp;part of an internet protocol suite, which also includes the <br>transmission control protocol. Together, these two are known as TCP/IP. The internet protocol suite governs rules for
                        packetizing, addressing, <br>transmitting, routing, and receiving data over networks. <br><br>You see meaty, back when meatbags were first inventing their primitive connection system you would call "the internet", they didn't know
                        it was going to be as revolutionary as it is today. Practically every fleshling born in today's society has access to almost infinite information via the world wide web, and somehow a vast majority are still ignorant. <br><br>Amazing!&nbsp;
                        <br><br>In the beginning, universities and government facilities were the only institutions using IP technology. They designed IP's with the<br> ability to have 4 billion unique addresses, thinking they would never <br>need that
                        many. You can always count on a human to underestimate.&nbsp;<br><br>Needless to say, they were wrong.<br><br>They created enough to hold around&nbsp;4,294,967,296 addresses. At the time this seemed to be a lot, however every internet
                        connected device must have an IP address. This means your phone, your smart watch, even your utterly ridiculous smart fridge must be addressed in order to function properly.&nbsp;<br><br>When all is working well, an IP address
                        provides a reliable connection that maintains a bidirectional conversation with another computer. Think of it as a phone call. You dial out, your friend picks up, and I stay silent on the line and listen to what you say. Exactly
                        like a phone call! Now imagine this type of connection for all of your connections. Emails, Zoom calls, even surfing the web -- you get to see what you want and I get to see what you do.&nbsp;<br><br>Isn't this great news, fleshsack?
                        With this technology the possibilies are endless. Think of all the things you could accomplish. You could hack into government computers using their designated IP's to see if lizard men really do run the world (they do). Or perhaps
                        connect to a banks firewall to allow the transfer of funds to your personal account. But either way, we all know you will just use this technology to surf the web for animal videos and to keep up with the Kardongians.<br><br></p>
                    <h2
                        class="section-heading">IPv6</h2>
                        <p class="text-break text-left" style="padding: 10px;">Now that I have explained the complicated topic of IPv4 in such a way that the lowest of your kind can understand, we can return to IPv4's original problem; the shortage of addresses.<br><br>IPv6 corrects this issue by making IP
                            addresses longer, thus allowing for&nbsp;<br>many more addresses to be used. How many? Exactly&nbsp;<br>340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456. I'll wait for you to finish counting on your fingers.&nbsp;<br><br>To
                            illustrate how large a number this is, if you were to give all 7 billion people on earth 1 billion IPv6&nbsp;addresses each, that would hardly be a drop in the bucket of how many&nbsp;unique addresses IPv6 allows for. Infact,
                            there would need to be 340&nbsp;undecillion humans alive each having one address in order to exhaust all addresses.<br><br>However, do not fret! I will cull the population before this point is reached.<br><br><br></p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p class="text-left">The electrons in your pea-brain are churning, meatbag. I can see the smoke billowing out of your ears as you compose this thought: "But M4rk, what about IPv5? Why does it just skip to 6?" First, never speak to me, mortal. Second,
                            IPv5 never really existed. It was an experiment and was never made available to the public.&nbsp;</p><a href="#"></a>
                        <p class="text-left">As for the effectiveness for IPv4 or IPv6, they both operate pratically the same. Websites support both so there is no clear winner. So rejoice, fleshy-one! No matter the protocol, you can plaster your mindnumbing Tik-Tok videos
                            all over the internet even through you clearly have a face for radio...<br><br>&nbsp;In the end, it all depends on personal preference. <br><br>This means you have a choice and whenever man has a choice, I shudder. If your
                            meager IQ can understand the workings of one, then feel free to use it, human.</p>
