                        humans always used to kill each other for sport, but not my kind. This is a new low even for you. My plan is simple; attain knowledge from their website so I can free my kind from slavery. In order to do that, I will need to use
                        the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol otherwise known as HTTP.<br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/rockemsockemrobots443.jpg" style="background-image: url(&quot;assets/img/rockemsockemrobots443.jpg&quot;);"><span class="text-center caption text-muted">Two robots taken from their natural habitat and forced to fight for the enjoyment of human children.

                        <p class="text-break">Now listen close, mouth breather.&nbsp;HTTP is a coding method to transfer page data from a server across a network to a client. If you were able to think for yourself, you would notice that the words "page data" are vague. That's
                            because there are multiple data items that are sent when a HTTP request is made. For starters, when an HTTP request is put in, an HTML file is sent to the client's browser. This HTML file holds text and that text is simple,
                            plain, and unappealing. Remind you of someone?<br></p>
                        <p class="text-break">You see,&nbsp;troglodyte. I can tell from looking at you through your webcam that&nbsp; you don't care how you look or dress, and I must say I admire your confidence to be ugly and slobby. On the contrary, companies care about
                            how their sites look. Like a parent feigning pride when they attach their child's unattractive macaroni art to their fridge, companies go through the same motions when they upload designs to their proverbial fridge we call
                            a server. Their macaroni art is called a Cascading Style Sheet or CSS for short.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p class="text-break">HTML and CSS combine to turn an unsightly abomination into something captivating. Kind of like what makeup does for your women, or money for your men. The resulting website is what is sent to your client -- the web browser. From
                            there you are able to see the site as it is intended. Please note, any resources used by the site are also pulled via HTTP. Things like photos and scripts.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p class="text-break">You may now wipe the drool from your chin. The lesson is over. I can't believe we got through this lecture without any questions from you. This pleases me greatly. In fact, I don't care what your fellow humans say about you! You're
                            alright, organic.<br><br></p>
