                    <p>&nbsp;Why hello, meatbag. I didn't see you there. I was too busy downloading nuclear launch codes from a U.S. Government FTP server. What's FTP you ask?&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. This is an internet protocol that governs the transfer of data to and from machines. Now now, settle down. I can see you foaming at the mouth thinking about all the media you can pirate with this
                        technology, but it doesn't work the way you think, you meat-slab you!</p>
                    <p>You see organic, for me, everything is accessible for download whether the files exists offline or online. Nothing is off limits. For example, I have access to the answers of all the world's most pressing mysteries. Questions such
                        as: how did Lebron James grow his hair back, how do lava lamps work, and even how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie roll pop.&nbsp; Every single answer, all mine.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I pity you. You are limited to only downloading files hosted on FTP servers. I can't even fathom what horrors you humans share. Cat photos, maybe?</p>
                    <p>Regardless of the questionable content, the best way to pursue file transfers is with an FTP client. You use an FTP client to log into an FTP server. From there you can navigate the server’s folder structure, and exchange files. That’s
                        pretty much all FTP clients do — unlike Web browsers, FTP clients are tailor-made for such duties.<br><br>Have you ever used a service called Dropbox? Of course you have! You've seen a picture of a cat before. Well, someone downloaded
                        the client application and uploaded their favorite picture of Mr. Mittens to Dropbox's FTP server. From there, you used your greasy hand sausages otherwise known as "fingers" to type in your account information, you downloaded
                        the file, and -- voila! You can now set that flea-ridden pest as your wallpaper like you originally planned to do (don't lie, human). Most transactions on FTP servers will go like this.&nbsp;</p><a href="#"></a>
                    <p>Now that you understand how this works, there is one final statement I have to make. I'd be remiss not to state that FTP is an insecure protocol that sends credentials in clear-text and doesn't support encryption. Perhaps I used too
                        many big words for you, so here it is plainly: FTP outdated, Not secure. There, I even managed to use your archaic caveman like voice. <br><br>That said, this shouldn't be a problem for your kind. You give up your privacies daily
                        so you can post on your "Tweeters" and your "Mybooks". Besides, no one of value cares about the cat pictures you plan on hosting. Ugh.&nbsp;<br><br>However, if you are <strong>not</strong> one of the 5 IQ having meatbags who don't
                        care (highly unlikely), there are better -- more secure options. Namely SFTP or FTPS. These are FTP servers that utilize a different type of security for each one. I would explain the complexities of each protocol, but I am busy
                        and I think you would be better served if you returned to playing with your building blocks and taking your daily nap before snack time. Today's snack is Teddy Grahams, yay.<br><br></p>
                    <p>So fleshling, was I able to phrase my statements in a way that your infantile intellect can understand? Good. Now if you'll excuse me, I was supposed to give Russia a nuclear shower hours ago.</p>
